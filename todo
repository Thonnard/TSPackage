R PROJECT – TOUCHSCREEN DATA

Workflow

0. Create R function to merge data from left and right boxes

1.	Load data into R.
-	R_Analysis_PD.abetRpt is file used to extract files from ABET II Software for operant touchscreen chambers. 
  Stored on shared network drive (J:).
-	Set working directory to: (?)
-	Read data file as: Reversal_Data.csv
-	Load required libraries (less is more): ...

2.	R Base.
- Add/Transform data:
  Total Trials, Log (RTs?), Perseveration Index (Bussey, et al., 2007), ...
  Split data into perseverative sessions (< 50 %), and non-perseverative sessions (50 % < x <= soft criterion)?
- Check input for mistakes (comma vs .) cf. duration; if necessary: if function with /1000
- Order data: mouse -> session (important for softCriterion.R) -> code: data <- data[with(data, order(Mouse,Session)), ]
  
  
-	Functions compatible for every variable:
  Descriptives function. 
    Parameters: DV, Group, Data.
    Make table and visualize with boxplots.
    To do: Add Q1, Q3, and IQR in table.

-	RMAnova function.
  Parameters: DV, Group, Time, Data.
  Perform Mixed-Effects model.
  Extract formal test statistics for assumptions: table and plots.
  Extract formal test statistics for RMAnova analysis: table and plots.
  Plot individual learning curves (line plots).
  Plot aggregate learning curves.

- Non-Linear function (Based on Piiponniemi, et al., 2017).
  Parameters: DV, Group, Data.
  Plot individual learning curves.
  Plot aggregate learning curves.

- Anova function (parametric). 
  Insert formal tests to test assumptions, add plots.
  Insert anova function. Which package?! Car, Base R, Afex, …
  Insert line plot.

- Non-parametric 'equivalent' to ANOVA?

- Add tests for trial blocks? E.g., Intra-trial learning? Compare blocks of Session #1 between and within groups?

3.  Statistical Report.
- R Markdown

(4.) function that checks performance during shaping (combining all shaping data + analysis)
